Introduction
============

Spectrum.js is a JavaScript template language targetted at both the server (e.g. node.js) and the client-side. It has a lightweight syntax, using embedded JavaScript for logic rather than inventing yet another language to learn. This "logic-ful" template approach ensures that all of you view logic can live within your views, in contrast to the some recent "logic-less" template" systems. It also borrows heavilly from <a href="http://masonhq.com/">Mason</a> to achieve high levels of reuse within your templates.

Usage
=====

Installation
------------

NPM is recommended for development, although for production you might want to find/build a package for your operating system:

    npm install spectrum

Loading
-------

To load Spectrum.js:

    var spectrum = require('spectrum');

Rendering a Template
--------------------

Create a new template renderer:

    var view = new spectrum.Renderer('/path/to/template/root');

Use this to render a template within the template root:
    
    view.render('/index.spv', { "view" : "data" }).then(function (output) {
        // rendered content is available in the output variable
    });

This page is my initial brain dump on template syntax and interface. This is all subject to change.

Template Syntax
---------------

### Code Lines

Lines of javascript can be mixed with the output by prefixing each line with a ':', e.g.

    : if (validation_error) {
        <p class="error">An error has occurred.</p>
    : }

Multiple lines run together, i.e. this works:

    : if (validation_error)
    : {
        <p class="error">An error has occurred</p>
    : }

### Expression Tags

An expression tag inserts the result of a javascript expression into the output, e.g.

    Hello <%= user.name %>.

### Code Tags

Code tags allow you to insert larger chunks of javascript code.

    <%
        var pi = 3.14159;
    %>

### Suppressed Line Breaks

To suppress a line-break, insert a backslash at the end of a line (or before trailing whitespace on the end of a line), e.g.

    Hello \
    <%= user.name %>

(results in 'Hello Tom' without a line-break).

This is more useful in plain text formats (e.g. plain text email) than html generation.

### Method Definitions

Method definitions are the primary unit of reuse. See below for how they are called.

    <~method name(parameter, list)>
        I am the output of the method_name method.
    </~method>

### Method Calls

Method calls are ordinary javascript method calls:

    The output is <[ this.method_name('blah', 'blah') ]>.

### Inheritance

By default, each template inherits from another template called <code>base.spv</code> in the template root. Rendering starts in the root of this template, with the content from the main template starting where the base template calls <code>next(this)</code>.

#### /base.spv

    <h1><% this.title() %></h1>
    
    <div class="content">
        <% next(this) %>
    </div>

#### /called/template.spv

    <~method title>My Template</~method>
    
    This appears within the content div.
